User Guide
==========

Welcome to ``predictably``'s user guide!

The purpose of the user guide is to provide further explanations and context
on how you can use ``predictably``'s functionality. Future documentation will also
provide a companion explanation of the algorithms and techniques available in
the package.

If your just looking for a technical specification of the functionality
that ``predictably`` provides, see the :ref:`api_ref`.

.. note::

    The user guide is under development. We have created a basic
    structure and are looking for contributions to develop the user guide
    further.
